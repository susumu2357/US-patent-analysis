These devices include leads that are implanted so as to be positioned proximate the walls of the heart, e.g., implanted into the chambers of the heart. These leads typically serve two functions, to deliver therapeutic stimulation to the heart of the patient, and to sense cardiac activity and provide signals indicative thereof to a control unit so that the control unit can determine whether to deliver stimulation to the patient\\'s heart. One problem that can occur over time is that the leads can become partially or fully fractured. In general, the leads are implanted into a very harsh environment where they are subject to repetitive mechanical stress and strain. Over a long time period, the lead can become fractured.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Fully fractured leads are generally incapable of delivering therapeutic stimulation to the heart of the patient. Partially fractured leads also provide problems in that they also may not be efficient at delivering therapeutic stimulation. Further, fractured leads can create noise on the lead. The noise signals may be interpreted by the control unit as indicative of heart activity. In worse case scenarios, the noise signals may be interpreted as a cardiac event that would by indicative of the need for stimulation to be applied to the heart. Consequently, lead fractures can result in the patient receiving heart stimulation when stimulation is not needed.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Unnecessary stimulation can potentially be very harmful to the patient. At a minimum, unnecessary stimulation can result in significant discomfort to the patient. Cardioversion or defibrillation waveforms, when delivered to a conscious patient, can be extremely painful. If the patient is periodically receiving unnecessary stimulations of this sort, the patient\\'s quality of life can be significantly affected. There have been instances where patients have suffered psychological harm as a result of receiving such stimulations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Certain parameters can be evaluated to assess the performance of a lead and to determine whether the lead has a partial or full fracture. One parameter is to measure the impedance of the lead. One difficulty with measuring impedance is that if the measurement is made at a time when high voltage stimulation is not being provided, e.g., the impedance measurement is made using a low voltage signal, the fracture may not be adequately detected. Often a partial fracture is difficult to detect at very low voltages so the source of noise which may result in inadvertent stimulation of the heart may go undetected.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Based upon the foregoing, there is a need for an improved way of sensing abnormalities with the leads of an implanted device that may result in spurious signals being received by the control unit thereby inducing the delivery of undesired therapeutic stimulations. To this end, there is a need for an analytic framework whereby impedance sensing on the lead may be performed in a manner that will more accurately determine whether there is a fracture or other physical problem with the lead that could be inducing noise.</p>\\n<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">A wide variety of systems, devices, methods, and processes comprising embodiments of the invention are described herein.

As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;coronary sinus region&#x201d; refers to the vasculature of the left ventricle, including any portion of the coronary sinus, great cardiac vein, left marginal vein, left posterior ventricular vein, middle cardiac vein, and/or small cardiac vein or any other cardiac vein accessible by the coronary sinus.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">Accordingly, an exemplary coronary sinus lead <b>24</b> is designed to receive atrial and ventricular cardiac signals and to deliver left ventricular pacing therapy using at least a left ventricular tip electrode <b>26</b>, left atrial pacing therapy using at least a left atrial ring electrode <b>27</b>, and shocking therapy using at least a left atrial coil electrode <b>28</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">The stimulation device <b>10</b> is also shown in electrical communication with the patient\\'s heart <b>12</b> by way of an implantable right ventricular lead <b>30</b> having, in this embodiment, a right ventricular tip electrode <b>32</b>, a right ventricular ring electrode <b>34</b>, a right ventricular (RV) coil electrode <b>36</b>, and a superior vena cava (SVC) coil electrode <b>38</b>. Typically, the right ventricular lead <b>30</b> is transvenously inserted into the heart <b>12</b> so as to place the right ventricular tip electrode <b>32</b> in the right ventricular apex so that the RV coil electrode will be positioned in the right ventricle and the SVC coil electrode <b>38</b> will be positioned in the superior vena cava. Accordingly, the right ventricular lead <b>30</b> is capable of receiving cardiac signals, and delivering stimulation in the form of pacing and shock therapy to the right ventricle.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">As illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, a simplified block diagram is shown of the multi-chamber implantable stimulation device <b>10</b>, which is capable of treating both fast and slow arrhythmias with stimulation therapy, including cardioversion, defibrillation, and pacing stimulation. While a particular multi-chamber device is shown, this is for illustration purposes only and one of skill in the art could readily duplicate, eliminate or disable the appropriate circuitry in any desired combination to provide a device capable of treating the appropriate chamber(s) with cardioversion, defibrillation and pacing stimulation.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">The housing <b>40</b> for the stimulation device <b>10</b>, shown schematically in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, is often referred to as the &#x201c;can&#x201d;, &#x201c;case&#x201d; or &#x201c;case electrode&#x201d; and may be programmably selected to act as the return electrode for all &#x201c;unipolar&#x201d; modes. The housing <b>40</b> may further be used as a return electrode alone or in combination with one or more of the coil electrodes, <b>28</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, for shocking purposes. The housing <b>40</b> further includes a connector (not shown) having a plurality of terminals, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> (shown schematically and, for convenience, the names of the electrodes to which they are connected are shown next to the terminals). As such, to achieve right atrial sensing and pacing, the connector includes at least a right atrial tip terminal (AR TIP) <b>42</b> adapted for connection to the atrial tip electrode <b>22</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">To achieve left chamber sensing, pacing and shocking, the connector includes at least a left ventricular tip terminal (VL TIP) <b>44</b>, a left atrial ring terminal (AL RING) <b>46</b>, and a left atrial shocking terminal (AL COIL) <b>48</b>, which are adapted for connection to the left ventricular tip electrode <b>26</b>, the left atrial ring electrode <b>27</b>, and the left atrial coil electrode <b>28</b>, respectively.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">To support right chamber sensing, pacing and shocking, the connector further includes a right ventricular tip terminal (VR TIP) <b>52</b>, a right ventricular ring terminal (VR RING) <b>54</b>, a right ventricular shocking terminal (RV COIL) <b>56</b>, and an SVC shocking terminal (SVC COIL) <b>58</b>, which are adapted for connection to the right ventricular tip electrode <b>32</b>, right ventricular ring electrode <b>34</b>, the RV coil electrode <b>36</b>, and the SVC coil electrode <b>38</b>, respectively.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">At the core of the stimulation device <b>10</b> is a programmable microcontroller <b>60</b> which controls the various modes of stimulation therapy. As is well known in the art, the microcontroller <b>60</b> typically includes a microprocessor, or equivalent control circuitry, designed specifically for controlling the delivery of stimulation therapy and may further include RAM or ROM memory, logic and timing circuitry, state machine circuitry, and I/O circuitry. Typically, the microcontroller <b>60</b> includes the ability to process or monitor input signals (data) as controlled by a program code stored in a designated block of memory. The details of the design and operation of the microcontroller <b>60</b> are not critical to the invention. Rather, any suitable microcontroller <b>60</b> may be used that carries out the functions described herein. The use of microprocessor-based control circuits for performing timing and data analysis functions are well known in the art.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, an atrial pulse generator <b>70</b> and a ventricular pulse generator <b>72</b> generate pacing stimulation pulses for delivery by the right atrial lead <b>20</b>, the right ventricular lead <b>30</b>, and/or the coronary sinus lead <b>24</b> via an electrode configuration switch <b>74</b>. It is understood that in order to provide stimulation therapy in each of the four chambers of the heart, the atrial and ventricular pulse generators, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, may include dedicated, independent pulse generators, multiplexed pulse generators, or shared pulse generators. The pulse generators, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, are controlled by the microcontroller <b>60</b> via appropriate control signals, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, respectively, to trigger or inhibit the stimulation pulses.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">The microcontroller <b>60</b> further includes timing control circuitry <b>79</b> which is used to control the timing of such stimulation pulses (e.g., pacing rate, atrio-ventricular (AV) delay, atrial interconduction (A-A) delay, or ventricular interconduction (V-V) delay, etc.) as well as to keep track of the timing of refractory periods, PVARP intervals, noise detection windows, evoked response windows, alert intervals, marker channel timing, etc., which is well known in the art.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">The switch <b>74</b> includes a plurality of switches for connecting the desired electrodes to the appropriate I/O circuits, thereby providing complete electrode programmability. Accordingly, the switch <b>74</b>, in response to a control signal <b>80</b> from the microcontroller <b>60</b>, determines the polarity of the stimulation pulses (e.g., unipolar, bipolar, combipolar, etc.) by selectively closing the appropriate combination of switches (not shown) as is known in the art. In this embodiment, the switch <b>74</b> also supports simultaneous high resolution impedance measurements, such as between the case or housing <b>40</b>, the right atrial electrode <b>22</b>, and right ventricular electrodes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> as described in greater detail below.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Atrial sensing circuits <b>82</b> and ventricular sensing circuits <b>84</b> may also be selectively coupled to the right atrial lead <b>20</b>, coronary sinus lead <b>24</b>, and the right ventricular lead <b>30</b>, through the switch <b>74</b> for detecting the presence of cardiac activity in each of the four chambers of the heart. Accordingly, the atrial (ATR. SENSE) and ventricular (VTR. SENSE) sensing circuits, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, may include dedicated sense amplifiers, multiplexed amplifiers, or shared amplifiers. The switch <b>74</b> determines the &#x201c;sensing polarity&#x201d; of the cardiac signal by selectively closing the appropriate switches, as is also known in the art. In this way, the clinician may program the sensing polarity independently of the stimulation polarity.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">Each sensing circuit, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, preferably employs one or more low power, precision amplifiers with programmable gain and/or automatic gain control, bandpass filtering, and a threshold detection circuit, as known in the art, to selectively sense the cardiac signal of interest. The automatic gain control enables the device <b>10</b> to deal effectively with the difficult problem of sensing the low amplitude signal characteristics of atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The outputs of the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, are connected to the microcontroller <b>60</b> which, in turn, are able to trigger or inhibit the atrial and ventricular pulse generators, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, respectively, in a demand fashion in response to the absence or presence of cardiac activity in the appropriate chambers of the heart.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">For arrhythmia detection, the device <b>10</b> utilizes the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, to sense cardiac signals to determine whether a rhythm is physiologic or pathologic. As used herein &#x201c;sensing&#x201d; is reserved for the noting of an electrical signal, and &#x201c;detection&#x201d; is the processing of these sensed signals and noting the presence of an arrhythmia. The timing intervals between sensed events (e.g., P-waves, R-waves, and depolarization signals associated with fibrillation) are then classified by the microcontroller <b>60</b> by comparing them to a predefined rate zone limit (i.e., bradycardia, normal, low rate VT, high rate VT, and fibrillation rate zones) and various other characteristics (e.g., sudden onset, stability, physiologic sensors, and morphology, etc.) in order to determine the type of remedial therapy that is needed (e.g., bradycardia pacing, anti-tachycardia pacing, cardioversion shocks or defibrillation shocks, collectively referred to as &#x201c;tiered therapy&#x201d;).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Cardiac signals are also applied to the inputs of an analog-to-digital (A/D) data acquisition system <b>90</b>. The data acquisition system <b>90</b> is configured to acquire intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) signals, convert the raw analog data into a digital signal, and store the digital signals for later processing and/or telemetric transmission to an external device <b>102</b>. The data acquisition system <b>90</b> is coupled to the right atrial lead <b>20</b>, the coronary sinus lead <b>24</b>, and the right ventricular lead <b>30</b> through the switch <b>74</b> to sample cardiac signals across any pair of desired electrodes.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">The microcontroller <b>60</b> is further coupled to a memory <b>94</b> by a suitable data/address bus <b>96</b>, wherein the programmable operating parameters used by the microcontroller <b>60</b> are stored and modified, as required, in order to customize the operation of the stimulation device <b>10</b> to suit the needs of a particular patient. Such operating parameters define, for example, pacing pulse amplitude, pulse duration, electrode polarity, rate, sensitivity, automatic features, arrhythmia detection criteria, and the amplitude, waveshape and vector of each shocking pulse to be delivered to the patient\\'s heart <b>12</b> within each respective tier of therapy.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">Advantageously, the operating parameters of the implantable device <b>10</b> may be non-invasively programmed into the memory <b>94</b> through a telemetry circuit <b>100</b> in telemetric communication with the external device <b>102</b>, such as a programmer, transtelephonic transceiver, or a diagnostic system analyzer. The telemetry circuit <b>100</b> is activated by the microcontroller by a control signal <b>106</b>. The telemetry circuit <b>100</b> advantageously allows IEGMs and status information relating to the operation of the device <b>10</b> (as contained in the microcontroller <b>60</b> or memory <b>94</b>) to be sent to the external device <b>102</b> through an established communication link <b>104</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">In the preferred embodiment, the stimulation device <b>10</b> further includes a physiologic sensor <b>108</b>, commonly referred to as a &#x201c;rate-responsive&#x201d; sensor because it is typically used to adjust pacing stimulation rate according to the exercise state of the patient. However, the physiological sensor <b>108</b> may further be used to detect changes in cardiac output, changes in the physiological condition of the heart, or diurnal changes in activity (e.g., detecting sleep and wake states). Accordingly, the microcontroller <b>60</b> responds by adjusting the various pacing parameters (such as rate, AV Delay, V-V Delay, etc.) at which the atrial and ventricular pulse generators, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, generate stimulation pulses.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">The stimulation device additionally includes a battery <b>110</b> which provides operating power to all of the circuits shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. For the stimulation device <b>10</b>, which employs shocking therapy, the battery <b>110</b> must be capable of operating at low current drains for long periods of time and then be capable of providing high-current pulses (for capacitor charging) when the patient requires a shock pulse. The battery <b>110</b> must also have a predictable discharge characteristic so that elective replacement time can be detected. Accordingly, embodiments of the device <b>10</b> including shocking capability preferably employ lithium/silver vanadium oxide batteries. For embodiments of the device <b>10</b> not including shocking capability, the battery <b>110</b> will preferably be lithium iodide or carbon monoflouride or a hybrid of the two.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">As further shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the device <b>10</b> is shown as having an impedance measuring circuit <b>112</b> which is enabled by the microcontroller <b>60</b> via a control signal <b>114</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">In the case where the stimulation device <b>10</b> is intended to operate as an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) device, it must detect the occurrence of an arrhythmia, and automatically apply an appropriate electrical shock therapy to the heart aimed at terminating the detected arrhythmia. To this end, the microcontroller <b>60</b> further controls a shocking circuit <b>116</b> by way of a control signal <b>118</b>. The shocking circuit <b>116</b> generates shocking pulses of low (up to 0.5 joules), moderate (0.5-10 joules), or high energy (11 to 40 joules), as controlled by the microcontroller <b>60</b>. Such shocking pulses are applied to the patient\\'s heart <b>12</b> through at least two shocking electrodes, and as shown in this embodiment, selected from the left atrial coil electrode <b>28</b>, the RV coil electrode <b>36</b>, and/or the SVC coil electrode <b>38</b>. As noted above, the housing <b>40</b> may act as an active electrode in combination with the RV electrode <b>36</b>, or as part of a split electrical vector using the SVC coil electrode <b>38</b> or the left atrial coil electrode <b>28</b> (i.e., using the RV electrode as a common electrode.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">Cardioversion shocks are generally considered to be of low to moderate energy level (so as to minimize pain felt by the patient), and/or synchronized with an R-wave and/or pertaining to the treatment of tachycardia. Defibrillation shocks are generally of moderate to high energy level (i.e., corresponding to thresholds in the range of 5-40 joules), delivered asynchronously (since R-waves may be too disorganized), and pertaining exclusively to the treatment of fibrillation. Accordingly, the microcontroller <b>60</b> is capable of controlling the synchronous or asynchronous delivery of the shocking pulses.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> shows that in some embodiments, a high voltage confirmation system (HVCS) <b>500</b> that can be functionally implemented by the micro-controller <b>60</b> of an implanted cardiac stimulation device <b>10</b>, can include an impedance data component <b>502</b> configured to facilitate one or more functionalities of the HVCS <b>500</b> based on impedance data. In one implementation, the impedance component <b>502</b> comprises the impedance measuring circuit <b>112</b>. For the purpose of description herein, it will be understood that &#x201c;impedance data&#x201d; or &#x201c;impedance&#x201d; can include impedance value itself and/or a derived value that is based on the impedance value. For example, a sampled impedance value a given time can be impedance data. In another example, an integrated value of impedance over some time interval can also be impedance data. Other derived values are also possible.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>, an HVCS <b>510</b> can include one or more leads <b>130</b> such as the leads <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>30</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> positioned to deliver high voltage treatment signal(s) to a heart. Such a lead <b>130</b> can be electrically connected to electrical components configured to measure resistance (depicted as an ohmmeter <b>120</b>) or the impedance measuring circuit <b>112</b> and/or analyze impedance (depicted as an impedance analyzer <b>122</b>) associated with the lead <b>130</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">As further shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>, the HVCS <b>510</b> can also include a processor <b>512</b> which can be either the microprocessor <b>60</b> or a stand-alone processor for processing of impedance data thus obtained (via the example ohmmeter <b>120</b> and/or impedance analyzer <b>122</b>). The HVCS <b>510</b> can also include a storage medium <b>514</b>, such as the memory <b>94</b> of the device <b>10</b> or a stand-alone memory having one or more processes, reference data, and other data, to facilitate processing of impedance data by the processor <b>512</b>. In some embodiments, the HVCS <b>510</b> can also include an interface <b>516</b>, such as the telemetry circuit <b>100</b> or a stand-alone device, configured to allow interfacing of the HVCS <b>510</b> with an external device <b>102</b>. Such interfacing can include, but not limited to, transfer of impedance data, transfer of reference data, and updating of one or more processes implemented in the implantable cardiac device.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">In general, it will be appreciated that processors can include, by way of example, computers, program logic, or other substrate configurations representing data and instructions, which operate as described herein. In other embodiments, the processors can include controller circuitry, processor circuitry, processors, general purpose single-chip or multi-chip microprocessors, digital signal processors, embedded microprocessors, microcontrollers and the like.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">Furthermore, it will be appreciated that in one embodiment, the program logic may advantageously be implemented as one or more components. The components may advantageously be configured to execute on one or more processors. The components include, but are not limited to, software or hardware components, modules such as software modules, object-oriented software components, class components and task components, processes methods, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, microcode, circuitry, data, databases, data structures, tables, arrays, and variables.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> shows examples of how impedance or impedance related values associated with the high voltage lead can be measured. As shown in an example configuration <b>400</b>, an implantable cardiac device <b>402</b> can include a high voltage device <b>404</b> configured to deliver high voltage waveform to the heart <b>12</b> in the manner discussed above. Such delivery can be effectuated by a high voltage electrode <b>406</b>, such as the electrodes <b>28</b>, <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, via a lead.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>, impedance measurement can be made between the electrode <b>406</b> and a location (for example, the casing <b>10</b>) so that the high voltage lead contributes to the resistance between the two measurement points. Thus, an ohmmeter <b>410</b> or other impedance measuring circuit <b>112</b> can measure an impedance that includes the contribution by the high voltage lead <b>406</b> and electrode <b>408</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">In certain situations, degradation of the lead can result in increase in impedance. In certain situations, however, a decrease in impedance can indicate some fault such as a possible short involving the lead or its connections. Thus, in examples described herein, detections of faulty lead can be based on some high and/or low impedance values or other values derived therefrom.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5-9</figref> show some non-limiting examples of impedance data that can be monitored and processed to facilitate one or more operational features of an HVCS. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows that in some embodiments, an impedance parameter such as impedance value Z associated with a high voltage lead can be sampled periodically. In an example impedance data <b>200</b>, a plurality of sampled impedance values are depicted as data points <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, a curve <b>202</b> can be obtained from the data points <b>204</b> (for example, by fitting) and represent time-dependence of impedance.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">In some embodiments, one or more impedance threshold values can be set such that a condition can be triggered if a sampled impedance value goes beyond the set threshold value(s). For example, a Z<sub>high </sub>threshold <b>206</b> can be set such that the example sampled value <b>204</b><i>c </i>exceeds the threshold <b>206</b>. In such a situation, an action associated with the HVCS can be triggered. An example of how such threshold can be set, as well as example triggered actions, are described below in greater detail.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">In another example, a Z<sub>low </sub><b>208</b> can be set such that if a sampled impedance value goes below the threshold (none shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>), an action associated with the HVCS can be triggered. An example of how such threshold can be set, as well as example triggered actions, are described below in greater detail.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows some non-limiting examples on variations in sampling techniques that can be utilized to sample impedance related parameters such as impedance value. In the example shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the impedance value can be sampled periodically, and each sampled value can be evaluated. In certain situations, the impedance values may fluctuate relatively rapidly, and it may be desirable to obtain average values that are less sensitive to such fluctuations. Thus, in an example impedance data <b>210</b> having impedance values <b>214</b> (that can be represented by a curve <b>212</b>), average values can be formed among groups <b>216</b> of values <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, the number of impedance values per group can be varied to achieve a desired averaging effect.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, an averaging group of impedance values can overlap with its neighboring group. In certain sampling situations, such grouping and overlapping can allow smoothing of data. In some embodiments, such group size and/or the amount of overlap can be varied to achieve a desired smoothing effect. Other data averaging and/or smoothing techniques are also possible.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example impedance data <b>220</b> where impedance values (depicted as a curve <b>222</b>) can be integrated over some time interval. For example, a plurality of integration time intervals are depicted as intervals <b>224</b>. An example interval <b>224</b><i>a </i>is shown to begin at time t=t<b>1</b> and end at t=t<b>2</b>, so that impedance is integrated to yield a Zdt value.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In some embodiments, such integration of impedance signal can be achieved by, for example, an integration circuit or via software using input sampled impedance values. The duration of the integration time interval(s) and/or any time intervals therebetween can be selected to achieve a desired range of Zdt values.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example Zdt data <b>230</b> that can result from the example Z data of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>. A plurality of Zdt data points <b>232</b> can represent integrated values of the corresponding intervals <b>224</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, a threshold Zdt value <b>234</b> can be set to allow comparison with the Zdt data points. In the example shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, a high threshold is shown; but it will be understood that a low threshold (not shown) can also be set. In the example, a Zdt data point <b>236</b> is depicted as exceeding the threshold value <b>234</b>. Thus, a detection of such a Zdt value can trigger an action associated with the HVCS.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">In some situations, use of Zdt may be less sensitive to Z signal fluctuations and provide a smoother trend indication of the impedance property of the high voltage lead. An example of how such threshold can be set, as well as example triggered actions, are described below in greater detail.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">In some embodiments, various other quantities can be derived from Z and/or Zdt values. In a non-limiting example, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example impedance data <b>240</b> where a trend of Zdt is plotted as a function of time. The data points <b>242</b> can represent a slope of the Zdt about the corresponding Zdt data points. For example, the first shown data point <b>242</b> can represent the slope of a line representing the first three data points <b>232</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, a threshold slop <b>244</b> can be set to allow comparison with the slope data points. In the example shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, a high threshold is shown; but it will be understood that a low threshold (not shown) can also be set. In the example, a slope data point <b>246</b> is depicted as exceeding the threshold value <b>244</b>. Thus, a detection of such a slope value can trigger an action associated with the HVCS.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">In some situations, use of such trend values may be less sensitive to Z signal fluctuations and provide a smoother trend indication of the impedance property of the high voltage lead.

In some embodiments, an impedance parameter reference <b>330</b> can be formed based on input of data from one or more sources. Empirical data <b>334</b> can be used to provide one or more impedance parameters. For example, an implantable cardiac device removed from a patient can be assessed for failure modes, and corresponding impedance data for high voltage lead can be obtained.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">In some embodiments, input for the reference <b>330</b> can be provided by a simulation component <b>336</b>. Such simulation can be configured to predict various electrical properties (including impedance properties) associated with the high voltage lead. Such simulation data can be verified by data obtained empirically or by other studies.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">In some embodiments, input for the reference <b>330</b> can be provides by laboratory data <b>338</b>. For example, characteristic changes in one or more impedance parameters can be studied in simulated conditions in the laboratory. In the examples shows in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the impedance Z and integrated impedance Zdt are depicted as increasing over time. Such increasing trend can be studies in the laboratory under controlled conditions, and one or more threshold conditions can be defines where the high voltage lead fails or becomes sufficiently undesirable.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">In some embodiments, various combinations of the example inputs <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, and <b>338</b> can be used to form the reference <b>330</b>. Other inputs are also possible.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">As described herein, impedance data measured or derived can be compared to a reference. In some embodiments, such a reference includes one or more threshold values. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example of how such threshold value(s) can be obtained.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example study <b>350</b> that can be conducted, where an implantable cardiac device <b>344</b> is subjected to a simulated environment <b>342</b>. While in such an environment, one or more impedance parameters can be measured and monitored (depicted as arrow <b>346</b>). Also, one or more performance related parameters can be monitored (depicted as arrow <b>348</b>). For example, the condition of the high voltage lead can be monitored for degradation.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">Based on such performance monitoring, an unacceptable or failure condition <b>360</b> can be identified (for example, at time t=T<sub>f</sub>). Such failure condition can be correlated (depicted as an arrow <b>370</b>) with the monitored impedance data <b>352</b> by, for example, identifying the value of the impedance parameter (depicted as threshold value <b>356</b>) corresponding to the failure time T<sub>f </sub>(depicted as time <b>354</b>).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">A wide variety of variations, however, are possible.
